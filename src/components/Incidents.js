          "I am a farmer, and my farm has been me and my family’s life and only source of income for as long as I can remember. Things were going well for us when we had the farm, but these horrible fires in northern California have taken everything we own. Our farm has been completely burnt down, including all of our cattle and crop. Without this, there is no way I can sustain my family, especially now that my wife and I have just had twins. I need help in order to get back on my feet, whether it is through donations, or volunteering, any help in order to grow my farm again, will go a long way for us. Thank you for your help.",

I am creating this initiative in order to ease the life of these homeless by buying and delivering them blankets. You can either donate money for the blankets, or help us distribute them.",

This is why as a community, we have a vital job to make sure we can give them the opportunities they deserve. The North Tract Elementary School however, is lacking serious funding for basic utensils, as well as a desperate need for teacher volunteers.",
